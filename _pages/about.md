I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests lie at the intersection of international relations, political psychology, and public opinion. 

I hold a MPhil in International Relations from the University of Oxford and a Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences from the University of Hong Kong.
