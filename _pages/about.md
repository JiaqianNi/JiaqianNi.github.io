I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of international relations, political psychology, and public opinion. My dissertation studies the role of uncertainty in the peace processes of international rapprochement and reconciliation. 

I hold two MPhil degrees in International Relations - one from the University of Oxford (2019) and another from the University of Hong Kong (2022). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences from the University of Hong Kong (2017).
