 * **Ni, Jiaqian**, Mengqiao Wang, and Kai Quek. 2024. "[The Sources of National Pride: Evidence from China and the United States](https://doi.org/10.1111/nana.13007)." *Nations and Nationalism*: 1â€“18. 
      * *Abstract*: National pride relates to nationalism, one of the most powerful forces in modern politics. Many surveys have shown that most citizens are proud of their countries, but few have directly examined the underlying reasons for why people are proud of their countries. Using parallel national surveys in China and the United States, we investigate the sources and contents of national pride in the two most powerful nation-states in the world. Our results reveal clear differences between citizens in the two countries. While the sources of American national pride are largely ideational, the sources of Chinese national pride tend to be material. The evidence provides a first set of insights into the sources of national pride and challenges conventional depictions of nationalism as a monolithic concept.
